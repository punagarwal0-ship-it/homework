# Statement MD for VITYARTHI PROJECT

## 1. Problem Statement
The librarian is writing everything in a notebook, a very slow process. Doing calculation for late fine can be complicated as sometimes, months have different days, leap year is confusing, also, paper records can get lost or damaged easily. This issue can be addressed by this project.

## 2. Scope of the project
This project is make only for small library or personal collection. It handles the basic work like issuing book and returning it. It does not have advance features like barcode scanner or internet database right now but we plan to add it for convenience of the user.

## 3. Target users
* School Librarians who want simple software.
* Students who manage class library.
* Anyone who has many books at home and want to track them.

## 4. High-level features
* **Book Management:** allow user to add new book to the list.
* **Transaction:** logic to give book and take it back from student.
* **Fine Calculation:** it calculates how many days is overdue and multiplies by fine amount.
* **Data Saving:** it saves everything in a csv file so data is safe even if we close the code.
